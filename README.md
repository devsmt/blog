## TODO
* Integrate dates into home page posts; improve formatting of dates all around
* Load configuration in as a JSON (or some such) file
  * Template files can be loaded in as a list (or two, depending on the results of the next bullet) of filenames that can be passed into `template.ParseFiles(...string)`
* Can I create a single template object for all my template files instead of creating HomeTemplate and DocumentTemplate objects with the same `base.html`, `css.html`, `google-analytics.html`, etc?
